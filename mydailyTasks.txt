when manager asks like this :venkat can you create your keys and copy to me ?

(Creating SSH keys and sharing them with your manager is a common practice in DevOps for secure access to servers, repositories, and other resources)

you need to do this two steps:
1. generate keys using a command "ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/my-devops-key"
2. share public key with your manager (copy the key by opening it using cat ~/.ssh/my-devops-key.pub )through mail or any other source
